# Iran BSD User Group

Iran BSD User Group is a venue for BSD hackers and anyone interested in BSD or UNIX to come together so as to share knowledge, discuss, work, make friends and hack stuff.
We meet on last Thursday of the month and we would be pleased to meet you.
Please consider reading the Code of Conduct before attending meetings or joining the IRC Channel (#irbug on Freenode).

And do not forget to check our Wiki by the way ;-)
